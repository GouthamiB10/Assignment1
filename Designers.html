        <p>The photographs in this guide represent the successful
        partnership between users, installation managers, designers,
        construction workers, and suppliers to bring about
        excellence in interior design. The photographs represent a
        broad range of facility types, locations, and design,
        construction, and furnishing techniques.
        In every case, an involved user initially defined the concept
        in terms of functional requirements and financial resources
        and demanded excellence pivotal to the success of these
        projects. Proper programming ensures the allocation of
        adequate military construction funds for building, and
        adequate maintenance funds to provide for furniture and
        furnishings. Superior programming results from having a
        clear vision of what the project is to be. Designers can be
        of assistance in defining the needs but the vision starts with
        the user.
        Superior programming enables excellence in design and
        construction. Excellence in design and construction results
        in facilities which optimize functional and aesthetic
        requirements and enable people to perform to their
        maximum potential.
