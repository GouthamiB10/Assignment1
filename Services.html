        <p class="ser-text">We all expect a facility to be functional and maintainable.
            Achieving coordination of the building interior and
            furnishings, meeting human ergonomic and psychological
            needs, and providing optimum aesthetic effect are
            identifiable and attainable goals for every interior design
            project.
            People's reactions to interior environments is critical to the
            success of every facility type. These reactions were first
            identified in healthcare facilities, where color, texture,
            lighting, furnishings, and finishes all contribute to creating
            an environment which supports patient recovery and wellbeing.
            Training, maintenance, laboratories, logistic support,
            medical, administrative, residential, morale, welfare and
            recreation facilities all have unique functional and aesthetic
            requirements. When these requirements are satisfied,
            workers, residents, and customers react positively, take
            pride in their contributions and in the facility, and perform
            to their maximum potential.
